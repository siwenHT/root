// The arb service: the CGO adapter that welds the pure NODE-04 cores (JobRegistry,
// WorkerPool, HandleStore — all in package arb, node-agnostic and unit-tested) onto
// the concrete *Ethereum node, plus the fixed set of runner goroutines that pull
// from a bounded queue and drive the already-verified target/prefix/candidate
// executors under a per-job read budget and cooperative cancel.
//
// This file lives in package eth (like arb_backend.go / arb_feed.go / arb_head.go)
// so it can touch *Ethereum, *state.StateDB and the executor directly without an
// import cycle. It holds NO simulation logic of its own — every subtle invariant
// (queue capacity, exactly-once slot release, cancel/complete race, idempotency,
// result TTL) already lives in the pure cores and is locked by their tests. Here we
// only: mint the boot id, run workers, decode wire requests into executor calls,
// and map executor results into JobOutcome.
//
// Cancellation model (v1): cooperative, per the wire contract ("arb_cancelJob does
// NOT promise the worker has exited; resource-release finality is observed via
// arb_getJob", §401). RequestCancel flips the job to CancelRequested and the worker
// holding the job's EVM cancel func trips it at the next cooperative check; the
// worker then runs to a bounded stop and Complete resolves the race to Cancelled,
// discarding any success evidence. A hard context interrupt is a later refinement.

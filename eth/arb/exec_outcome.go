// Execution outcome classification core (NODE-03, design §8.2/§277/§333/§349). This
// is the node-agnostic, honesty-critical state machine that maps the raw signals of
// a single transaction execution onto the FROZEN wire status enum. It imports
// nothing from the parent eth package (no CGO); the real ApplyTransactionWithEVM
// execution lives in the parent-package adapter, which feeds its signals here.
//
// Wire status enum (design §318, authoritative):
//
//	success | invalid | reverted | cancelled | stale | failed
//
// The single most important rule (design §277): cancellation and backend read
// errors are marked as infrastructure failure / cancellation FIRST, BEFORE the
// receipt is even consulted. A cancelled or errored run's receipt is post-interrupt
// garbage; treating its Status as a real revert, or its absence of error as
// success, would fabricate a result. §333 reinforces: never return a fake canonical
// receipt, never fill an unexecuted tx's fields with zero. So this classifier also
// reports whether the receipt-derived fields (gas/logs) are TRUSTWORTHY; when they
// are not, the adapter must omit them, not zero-fill them.
//
// core error (nonce/balance/fee) vs receipt-failed (revert/OOG) are separate (§277):
// the former is `invalid` (the tx could not even be applied — protocol/validity);
// the latter is `reverted` (the tx executed and entered-block-eligible but failed,
// which policy rejects). We never collapse them into a single err==nil check.

// Budgeted state-read accounting core (NODE shared infra, design §379-381). This
// is the node-agnostic counter/cap/latch state machine that enforces max_state_reads
// and guarantees that a budget-exceeded read FAILS rather than returning a faked
// zero. It imports nothing from the parent eth package (no CGO). The concrete
// binding wraps vm.StateDB and the typed PoolReader around this core
// (eth/arb_budget.go), charging one logical read per GetState / GetCommittedState /
// GetCode / GetCodeHash / GetCodeSize / GetBalance / GetNonce / GetStorageRoot.
//
// Contract (design §379-381, honesty-critical):
//
//   - Logical reads are counted here; this is NOT disk IO (a cached read still
//     counts one logical read, a cold read still counts one). The design is explicit
//     that logical read count != disk IO count, and that a wrapper cannot abort an
//     already-blocked disk read — so this bounds work admitted, not latency.
//   - When the cap is reached, ChargeRead returns false and latches `exceeded`. The
//     adapter MUST then request EVM cancel and fail the job. It must NEVER hand back
//     a zero/empty value as if the read succeeded (§381 "不要返回伪造零值作为成功
//     读取"). Once latched, every subsequent ChargeRead also returns false.
//   - A wall-clock deadline is layered on top (design §291: server builds the
//     deadline from a local monotonic clock, taking min(client_budget, server_cap);
//     it never trusts a client-sent Instant/absolute deadline). DeadlineExceeded is
//     also a latched terminal condition.
